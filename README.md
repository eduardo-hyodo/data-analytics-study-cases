## 🧠 Case Study 1: Bellabeat – How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

### Overview
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. In this case study, I analyze user behavior data collected via Fitbit to help Bellabeat understand how consumers use smart devices in their health routines — and how the company can make informed product and marketing decisions.

### Objective
Apply the data analysis process to answer the question:  
**"How can Bellabeat use smart device data to unlock new growth opportunities?"**
